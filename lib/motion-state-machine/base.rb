# Hey, this is +motion-state-machine+, a state machine designed for
# RubyMotion.
#
# It comes with a simple syntax to define states and transitions (see
# {Base#when}). It is aware of Grand Central Dispatch queues and uses
# them for synchronization.
#
# Its home is {https://github.com/opyh/motion-state-machine}.
#
# See the {file:README.md} for an overview and introduction.
#
# You might also want to look at {Base#when} and {State::TransitionDefinitionDSL}.

module StateMachine

  # Base class of a finite state machine (FSM). See {StateMachine} for
  # an overview.

    #   machine was started (or +nil+ if the state machine has
    #   not been started yet)

    # @return [String] Name of the state machine.
    #   Only used in debug output.

    #   state, e.g. after exiting and before entering a new state)
    attr_accessor :current_state


    # Initializes a new StateMachine.
    #
    # @param options [Hash]
    #   Configuration options for the FSM.
    #
    # @option options [Symbol] :start_state
    #   First state after start
    #
    # @option options [String] :name ("State machine")
    #   Name used in debugging output (optional)
    #
    # @option options [Boolean] :verbose (false)
    #   Indicate if the machine should output log texts to console.
    #
    # @example
    #   fsm = StateMachine::Base.new start_state: :awake

    # you refer to with symbols are created automatically, on-the-fly,
